# Log File Analyzer  

The **Log File Analyzer** is a Python-based application designed to parse server log files and extract meaningful insights. This tool enables administrators and developers to identify high-traffic IPs, popular endpoints, and IPs with failed login attempts. The processed data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis.  

The application leverages Python's standard libraries for seamless performance and does not require additional dependencies.
